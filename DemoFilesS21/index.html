		<p> Information is accurate as of the date it was queried from the system of record, but should be considered a close approximation of current records, due to complaint revisions and updates. <br><br>

			Crime complaints which involve multiple offenses are classified according to the most serious offense. Attempted crimes are recorded regardless of whether or not the criminal act was successful, except in the instance of Attempted Murder, which is recorded as Felony Assault. <br><br>

			The Report Date represents the date the incident was actually reported to the NYPD. This dataset is released based on the date the incident was reported, not necessarily when it occurred. Some crimes may have occurred years before they were reported. </p>
